## Hand written SVGs

I tried to learn SVG elements by writing them manually in sourcecode. In 2015 I tried to draw a LEGOâ„¢ figure technical drawing manually from an image. Here is the effort:
![Technical drawing minifigure](/assets/img/svg/Technical_drawing_minifigure.png)
![lego figure](/assets/img/svg/lego.svg)

Now I had to draw a blueprint from a flat. I had this image as orientation of measurements:
![blueprint sketch](/assets/img/svg/blueprint-sketch.jpg)

The final [blueprint SVG](/assets/img/svg/blueprint.svg){:target="_blank"}. Again, no graphical program was used, it is written manually, please check source:
![blueprint](/assets/img/svg/blueprint.svg)
