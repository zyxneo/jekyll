# Projects

Below listed several pages from my free-time projects. For work related projects visit [linkedin](https://hu.linkedin.com/in/balázs-szilágyi-112987121).

## Websites (private)

* [manonet.org](http://manonet.org) - Typewriter program (Joomla, Flash)
* [bernathjudit.hu](http://bernathjudit.hu) - Bernáth Judit portfolio page (2006, Flash)  - My very first website from 2006. I make it from my own, without any help. I learned flash, I made all the photos, even the guestbook. I tried to take care on smallest details, to translate it, and to make it a worthy portfolio for Judit. I also programmed the slider. Now i recognize that I also programmed basic error handling :) It is always a nice to have. I think, I have take the advantage of animation in flash properly, plus the interactivity, the matching music (3-5 track) So it was a "full stack" project, with the first "internet learnings".
* [lurkovarovoda.hu](http://lurkovarovoda.hu/) - Lurkóvár óvoda (2012, Flash) - The kindergarten was liked it, they still keep it.
